  <div class="hidden_block">
    <p class="hidden_title">Why should I use Cougardates?</p>
    <div class="hidden_body">
      The point of Cougardates is to allow students at BYU to have an easier experience dating. Many students struggle to find time to date, or they have a hard time finding
      the right girl. A <a href="https://universe.byu.edu/2015/10/20/students-research-on-byu-dating-shows-surprising-results1/">2015 survey</a> of students found that
      students were only going on two dates per month! Some people hadn't even gone on a single date their entire time at BYU. Cougardates makes finding and planning dates
      much easier for you to do.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="hidden_block">
    <p class="hidden_title">Why can't I use Cougardates if I'm not a BYU student, even if I'm living close by?</p>
    <div class="hidden_body">
      Linking information to your BYU account adds a measure of security. It ensures that you live near BYU, and you are of college age. Also, all BYU students are required
      to obey the Honor Code (or they can get kicked out of BYU) so this helps keep Cougardates a morally safe space.
      <br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the website is tailored entirely towards BYU students. If you weren't a BYU student you would become confused when others put "ACME Chemistry Emphasis" on their
      profile, and BYU students would be equally confused by your class or major descriptions. In addition, we also have a page with deals from local companies that have only been
      offerred to BYU students.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="hidden_block">
    <p class="hidden_title">Has BYU endorsed this website?</p>
    <div class="hidden_body">
      No, BYU does not endorse this website. Cougardates has been created independently by a student.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="hidden_block">
    <p class="hidden_title">Is there an age limit for participating?</p>
    <div class="hidden_body">
      Yes, ages 18-30.
      <br>
      <br>
      Almost all BYU students should fall in this category. Occasionally though there is a student who graduates highschool early and begins college before they turn 18. If that is you,
      unfortunately you can't use this website until you turn 18. We don't want to get into legal trouble.
      <br>
      <br>
      Why is there an upper limit? When students graduate they normally still keep
      their email, net ID, and other accounts linking them to BYU. So theoretically a 50 year old alumni could create a Cougardates account using their old college net ID. The upper age
      limit is to prevent people who are no longer students from using the website. If you happen to be still a student and are above the age of 30, you can email us at
      <a href="mailto:help@cougardates.com">help@cougardates.com</a> to get an exception. Though you may want to consider just using a different dating app like Mutual as all of the
      users here will be far younger than you.

  <div class="hidden_block">
    <p class="hidden_title">What is the "Deals" page?</p>
    <div class="hidden_body">
      This page is where local businesses advertise their restuarants. We require them
      to include some kind of deal for you students; it may be a coupon, cheaper pricing
      if you show your BYU id, or a reduced entry fee between certain hours. This
      way it's not just a bunch of advertisements for youâ€”you actually get something
      out of it.
      <br>
      <br>
      It's also where we make our money. If you notice, we don't have
      advertisements anywhere else on our website for a variety of reasons. We
      personally find advertisements annoying and so we don't want to do that to
      you! Also, some Google ads are gross or insensitive. There are ways to try
      to block those kinds of ads but it isn't perfect. So we opted instead to
      have a page full of advertisements from local businesses that we can vet
      ourselves.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you are interested in advertising with us, email us at
      <a href="mailto:advertise@cougardates.com">advertise@cougardates.com</a>.
